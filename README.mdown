# What is it?

This is a tool to start a drag session for a file from the terminal. I found I was often running `open .` from within a terminal just so I could drag a file to an application, so this was to avoid that.

# Building

Compile it with

`g++ drag.mm -framework Cocoa -o drag`

Then you can move or symlink it to somewhere in your `PATH`.

# Usage

Just run:

`drag «file»`

You can use tildes and relative paths.
